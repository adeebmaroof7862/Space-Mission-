# Space-Mission-
This project is based on the Space Mission which shows the growth and success rate of missions by various countries in perticular year.

I used SpaceMission data which is available on internet which contains two tables "Space_Missions" and "Date Table" with having certain variables, I joined both of the tables on "Date" variable and used data to create Visualizations.

The Dashboard contain multiple graphs like "KPI'S", "Bar Graphs", "Scatter Plot", "Line Graph", "Filters", etc.

To create these visualizations I created multiple "Measure" Variables with the help of "DAX QUERY" and i stored them in the table name "All Measures".
